# Google Cloud Image Service

Post method URI = http://localhost:8080/store

Note : There is no integration of google cloud bucket. This service only send picsum URL to rabbitmq. For testing this
application you need to install rabbitmq and if you have any special configuration then need to configure in
application.properties because I am using the default settings so no need to add anything.
